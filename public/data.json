            "As part of Nike’s \"The Chance\" campaign, we developed a frontend application which allowed users to to upload a photo of themselves via social media or webcam, modify the look by selecting a face type and hair and create digital version of the next hero in football. The application would generate several posters and a video with a narrative, featuring the user’s avatar as the next football superstar.",
            "The Chance attracted 150,000 young competitors from 55 countries across the globe, all vying to get the attention of Nike Football’s elite scouts on social media. We picked 100 potential stars and trained them hard. The Chance generated unprecedented levels of interest and engagement; 1.5 million Facebook app installs, 3.8 million likes and comments on social, 10 million YouTube views and 17 million social interactions. The competition earned the brand huge kudos and cemented Nike Football as the number one brand among teenage footballers."
